I would normally blame this partially on the rent, but does that apply to a sidewalk on the corner of 84th and Broadway? I know the people selling them freeze outside and sleep in nearby vans.

They were having a 50% off sale (for $29.95), but I think that $60 for a tree is excessive. I think the cost of labor and transportation are factored into the cost, but here in NYC there is always a very hefty markup on Christmas trees (and everything else!).

I think the early purchase went into setting the price. They wouldn't hagle, would only direct us to a cheaper, scrawnier tree. Think I paid $10 too much, but we do smile when we walk into our apartment and see the pretty tree over in the corner (the needles are still on!!).

They aren't perfectly shaped and I couldn't swear to their freshness, but once you find their best side and cover them with ornaments, they look greatand they smell great. We visit family for the week of Christmas anyway, so if we couldn't get this kind of a bargain, I'm not sure we'd have a tree here at home.

Brookly Christmas tree charges 11/foot and came with free delivery if I mentioned the website. It arrived on a sunday morning at 8:30am. My son and I were still in our pajamas, A very nice woman, the daughter of the french canadian tree farmer, carried it into our apartment.  Its A Perfect Tree and we were decorating by 8am. If I'd bought it on the corner I would have spent about 125, had to get it home myself, and would have spent an hour picking it out. This one is the most beautiful we've ever had! And it came to us.

The 30 - 40 or 40 - 50? Anybody who's ever taken a measurement class knows that you have to do $30 - 39 and $40 - 49. I paid $40 plus a $2 tip so I picked $40-50. But this was the tiniest tree I've ever seen, and I find it expensive. Though it did come with a (cheap) stand, which I appreciate.

Sure, it's a lot of money-- but we save up extra to have a special tree each year. We are also paying for the convenience of picking it up on a street just blocks from our home. No need to strap it to a car or anything. I am sure some of the cost comes from transporting the tree from North Carolina (where the man said it was from) and keeping it healthy. Also, they need someone to stay with the trees 24 hours a day, so that none are stolen... But when it's bitter cold outside and you've walked blocks to and from the subway, trudging through wind and slush, nothing beats coming home to a twinkling tree during the holiday season.

The Fraziers were $20/ft so a 6 ft would have set me back $240.  I always buy from the same stand, part of the Quebec syndicate that runs many of the stands in Manhattan. (although this year the tree guys are from London - go figure). Prices seemed much higher than the past few years.  Price of these trees = growing, trucking from Canada, maintaining stand. Would love to go less expensive but hard in midtown Manhattan.  Plus the guys (and sometimes women) are always entertaining - they live in their van the month they're here.  They buy the trees wholesale from the main guy who trucks them down from Canada and refreshes the stock every few days; they then keep the proceeds.  What the hey - Christmas is only once a year.

Trees are expensive, but they only can be sold for a limited time during the year, and obviously there is a somewhat inelastic demand -- you might buy a smaller tree if they are overpriced, but you will not go without a tree.

They cut a couple inches off the bottom without me having to ask. They're close, just a block and a half away from my apartment. The tree was nice and full when I opened it up at home.

So while I wish I had spent $15 - $20 less, it's a beautiful tree and I wasn't put off by the price.
