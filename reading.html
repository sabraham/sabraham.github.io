        <p>
        Phil Knight does a world-tour, builds an iconic brand.
      </p>
        <p>
        What struck me most is how much he and his companions believe in their mission to sell running shoes. There's a funny story early in the book about Knight getting waylaid in Hawaii by the nice weather and pretty ladies, and to make ends meet, he takes a job as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesperson, but never makes a sale. With Nike, he believes so much in running and the shoes they sell that he's able to sell to Japanese shoe makers, factories, sales reps, track stars, his family -- the world, really. He doesn't go outright and say it, but it's alluded to many times, that he believes it was his destiny to sell shoes, to be a prophet/messiah for running.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vast majority of the narrative is a story about lack of capital. Banks won't lend to Nike, because they're too leveraged, taking all profit and plowing into further growth. In a world of more developed capital markets, ie, venture, Phil Knight would have slept a lot better, Nike would have grown faster, and this memoir would be 80% shorter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nike has been innovating the running shoe since its first days as a shoe manufacturer. Nike's recent break of the 2-hour marathon barrier reflects this tradition. After I finished the memoir, I bought a new set of Nike running gear.

          Steckel is an economist at The Ohio State University, and White is a management consultant at Pope &
          Associates, Inc. The paper's contribution is an estimate of the benefit of an individual technological
          improvment, in contrast with an assumption of most growth economists who believe that any individual
          improvement is too minor to study in isolation. The authors estiamte that the tractor and related equipment
          produced a social savings of $29.2 billion, of 8% of US GNP in 1954.

      <div class="notes">
        <p>Per capita number of people working on farms has dropped enormously. In 1910, 13 million people worked on
          farms. In
          2012, 6 million people worked on farms. The population in 1910 was 92 million. In 2012, it was 310 million.
          This
          represents a 6 fold decrease in required labor inputs from 1 in 7 people to fewer than 1 in 50 people.</p>
        <p>Low agricultural productivity growth encourage developmental economists to recommend transferring resources
          out of agriculture into higher-growth industries as a necessary condition for countries to grow. The
          low-growth in agriculture was true in total dollar or unit terms (total dollar value of annual agricultural
          products, total bushels produced), but not in rate terms (bushels per labor hour). </p>
        <p>In 1910, farmland made up half of total land area in the continental US (879 million acres; Arizona and New
          Mexico were not admitted as states yet). 1/3 of this, 310 million acres, were used for growing crops.</p>
        <p>Prior to 1910, most crops were grown, cultivated, and harvested using animal power or manual labor. Steam and
          gasoline engines had limited impact on farming due to their massive size and weight.</p>
        <p>1910 census values horses and mules on the farm at $2.6 billion, or about 6% of all farm property, and
          implenents and machinery valued at $1.27 billion. Capital intensity can be calculated at $12.52 per acre,
          staying constant for the first half of the century.</p>
        <p>Advancements in tractor technology: power lift by Deere in 1927; rubber tires, replacing steel wheels, in
          1932; and development of diesel engines in the mid-1930s.</p>
        <p>Tractor development stops in 1934, changing little in design for 30 years. Despite the depression, tractor
          sales increase rapidly until 1960, when increase in percentage of farms iwth tractors stops (outside of the
          cotton South).</p>
        <p>Amount of land used to grow field crops stayed roughly the same. In 1954, 329 million acres were used (6%
          increase from 1909). Large decreases in corn and cotton acreage were balanced by 18 million acres of soybeans
          and 16 million acres of grain and sorghum. By 1954, tractors were used to plow and prepare nearly all this
          land.</p>
        <p>Farm labor force of 1954 was significantly smaller than that of 1910. Half of the nation's farm operators
          held paying jobs away from the farm. More than 1 million of these operators worked more than 200 days per year
          off-farm. The hired work force worked fewer days per year, mostly during harvest time, as tractors had
          replaced the demand for more steady labor. Hired laborers are estimated to have increased by 10% from 2.8
          million to 3 million.</p>
        <p>Further reading: Johnson and Gustafson estimated that mechanization was responsible for one-third of the
          increase in corn yields in the 20th century.</p>

        <p>Einav, Farronato, and Levin are all economists interested in industrial organization. They
          are at Stanford, Harvard Business School, and Stanford Graduate School of Business, respectively.</p>
        <p>This paper is interested in peer-to-peer internet marketplaces: (1) design of internet marketplaces, (2) the
          economics of peer production, and (3) regulatory issues that were emerging in 2015.</p>

        <p><i>Market Design of P2P marketplaces</i></p>
        <p>Transactions rely on spot transactions over long-term contracts/employment relationships.</p>
        <p>The decline in auctions in e-commerce extends to P2P markets. Many marketplaces started with auction pricing
          but have moved to some type of set pricing. Prosper (a lending
          marketplace) replaced its auction mechanism (interest rate) with a centralized pricing algorithm. Study shows
          risk is priced about the same, but the funding process has been greatly simplified.
        </p>
        <p>The pricing unit matters greatly. Airbnb prices by night, not by number of guests per unit, as the former is
          easier to observe, reducing monitoring costs. TaskRabbit cleaning priced by hour not by job, and online ad
          marketplaces (Google, Facebook) moving to click/conversion pricing over impression pricing, are examples of
          aligning incentives between marketplaces and market participants.</p>
        <p>Feedback and review systems are extremely pervasive and 98% of feedback is positive, but seems to weed out
          the worst actors.</p>
        <p>A central challenge with P2P marketplaces is presenting options to buyers. P2P marketplaces are characterize
          by high degrees of heterogenity, influencing decision by marketplace to de/centralize the matching process.
          Transport is more homogenous so Uber centralizes the process. Accomodation is more heterogeneous, so Airbnb
          decentralizes the process to facilitate individual choice.</p>
      </div>
      <p><i>Economics of Peer Production</i></p>
      <p>The authors create a theoretical model of professional/dedicated sellers and casual/peer sellers and derive
        intuitive results from the model. This is less interesting. </p>
      <p>Volatile market demand favors the peer sellers. High capacity costs and frequent low-end marginal costs favor
        peer sellers. A study of TaskRabbit worker price sensitivity showed it to be very elastic: a 10% increase in
        wage rate led to workers applying for 30% more jobs.</p>
      <p>P2P markets work when a new technology reduces the marginal cost of advertising (finding customers). A critical
        mass of supply is necessary, as the marginal advertising cost is reduced for each market participant with each
        additional supply unit.</p>
      <p><i>Regulatory Issues</i></p>
      <p>Two possible reasons for regulation: (1) to protect consumers (in response to market failure), (2) to protect
        incumbents. </p>
      <p>There isn't a global reputation system for contractor workers. This was pitched as a business idea recently

          Analysis of the Labor Market for Uber’s Driver-Partners in the United States"</a> <i>NBER Working Paper
          Series</i> 2016</div>
      <div class="summary">
        <p>Hall is now Uber's Chief Economist and Alan Krueger was a Princeton labor economist who served as chair of
          the Council of Economic Advisors in the Obama administration.</p>
        <p>Through direct access to Uber's observed ride data and driver surveys, Hall and Krueger determine Uber
          drivers
          greatly prefer the flexibility Uber offers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="notes">
        <p><i>Uber driver growth has been driven by people seeking flexible work arrangements</i></p>
        <p>
          When surveyed, 3 out of the top 4 reasons for joining Uber were related to having control of work scheduling.
        </p>
        <p>UberX growth was exponential, whereas UberBlack growth was linear. Proportion of drivers driving 15 or fewer
          hours a week trended up, whereas
          drivers driving between 16 to 35 hours and 35+ hours trended down. UberBlack drivers are more likely </p>
        <p>When surveyed, 74% (5%) of drivers said Uber made their life better (worse).</p>
        <p>When asked to state preference between work descriptions that corresponded to independent contractor versus
          employee relationships, 79% of drivers
          said they would prefer an independent contractor relationship.</p>
        <p>Female drivers were more likely to state a preference for flexibility than male drivers were. This reminds me
          of
          findings of Claudia Goldin.</p>
        <p><i>Uber is largely supplemental income</i></p>
        <p>80% of drivers report they were working full- or part-time before
          starting on Uber. 10% of drivers were unemployed immediately before joining Uber. For the overall economy, 25%
          of
          new hires come from unemployment.</p>
        <p><i>The number one factor in driver growth was meeting unmet demand</i></p>
        <p>Number of Uber drivers in a city is a linear function of (1) city's population, (2) how long Uber has been
          operating in the city, and (3) log number of existing taxi licenses. All factors are positive, so (3)'s
          implication is that the the more licenses there are, the more unmet demand there was (or, the more artifically
          constrained supply was). Factors that did not determine driver growth include (1) population density, (2)
          population GDP, (3) taxi earnings, (4) regional unemployment, (5) cost of a 5-mile trip in the city, and (5)
          cars
          as a proportion of poulation.</p>
