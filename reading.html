    <div>Hall, Jonathan V and Krueger, Alan B, <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22843">"An Analysis of the Labor
        Market for Uberâ€™s Driver-Partners in the United
        States"</a> <i>NBER Working Paper Series</i> 2016</div>
    <p>Hall is now Uber's Chief Economist and Alan Krueger was a Princeton labor economist who served as chair of the
      Counceil of Economic Advisors in the Obama administration.</p>
    <p>Through direct access to Uber's observed ride data and driver surveys, Hall and Krueger determine Uber drivers
      greatly prefer the flexibility Uber offers.</p>
    <p><i>Uber driver growth has been driven by people seeking flexible work arrangements</i></p>
    <p>
      When surveyed, 3 out of the top 4 reasons for joining Uber were related to having control of work scheduling.</p>
    <p>UberX growth was exponential, whereas UberBlack growth was linear. Proportion of drivers driving 15 or fewer
      hours a week trended up, whereas
      drivers driving between 16 to 35 hours and 35+ hours trended down. UberBlack drivers are more likely </p>
    <p>When surveyed, 74% (5%) of drivers said Uber made their life better (worse).</p>
    <p>When asked to state preference between work descriptions that corresponded to independent contractor versus
      employee relationships, 79% of drivers
      said they would prefer an independent contractor relationship.</p>
    <p>Female drivers were more likely to state a preference for flexibility than male drivers were. This reminds me of
      findings of Claudia Goldin.</p>
    <p><i>Uber is largely supplemental income</i></p>
    <p>80% of drivers report they were working full- or part-time before
      starting on Uber. 10% of drivers were unemployed immediately before joining Uber. For the overall economy, 25% of
      new hires come from unemployment.</p>
    <p><i>The number one factor in driver growth was meeting unmet demand</i></p>
    <p>Number of Uber drivers in a city is a linear function of (1) city's population, (2) how long Uber has been
      operating in the city, and (3) log number of existing taxi licenses. All factors are positive, so (3)'s
      implication is that the the more licenses there are, the more unmet demand there was (or, the more artifically
      constrained supply was). Factors that did not determine driver growth include (1) population density, (2)
      population GDP, (3) taxi earnings, (4) regional unemployment, (5) cost of a 5-mile trip in the city, and (5) cars
      as a proportion of poulation.</p>
