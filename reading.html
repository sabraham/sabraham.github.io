        <p>Einav, Farronato, and Levin are all economists interested in industrial organization. They
          are at Stanford, Harvard Business School, and Stanford Graduate School of Business, respectively.</p>
        <p>This paper is interested in peer-to-peer internet marketplaces: (1) design of internet marketplaces, (2) the
          economics of peer production, and (3) regulatory issues that were emerging in 2015.</p>

        <p><i>Market Design of P2P marketplaces</i></p>
        <p>Transactions rely on spot transactions over long-term contracts/employment relationships.</p>
        <p>The decline in auctions in e-commerce extends to P2P markets. Many marketplaces started with auction pricing
          but have moved to some type of set pricing. Prosper (a lending
          marketplace) replaced its auction mechanism (interest rate) with a centralized pricing algorithm. Study shows
          risk is priced about the same, but the funding process has been greatly simplified.
        </p>
        <p>The pricing unit matters greatly. Airbnb prices by night, not by number of guests per unit, as the former is
          easier to observe, reducing monitoring costs. TaskRabbit cleaning priced by hour not by job, and online ad
          marketplaces (Google, Facebook) moving to click/conversion pricing over impression pricing, are examples of
          aligning incentives between marketplaces and market participants.</p>
        <p>Feedback and review systems are extremely pervasive and 98% of feedback is positive, but seems to weed out
          the worst actors.</p>
        <p>A central challenge with P2P marketplaces is presenting options to buyers. P2P marketplaces are characterize
          by high degrees of heterogenity, influencing decision by marketplace to de/centralize the matching process.
          Transport is more homogenous so Uber centralizes the process. Accomodation is more heterogeneous, so Airbnb
          decentralizes the process to facilitate individual choice.</p>

      <p><i>Economics of Peer Production</i></p>
      <p>The authors create a theoretical model of professional/dedicated sellers and casual/peer sellers and derive
        intuitive results from the model. This is less interesting. </p>
      <p>Volatile market demand favors the peer sellers. High capacity costs and frequent low-end marginal costs favor
        peer sellers. A study of TaskRabbit worker price sensitivity showed it to be very elastic: a 10% increase in
        wage rate led to workers applying for 30% more jobs.</p>
      <p>P2P markets work when a new technology reduces the marginal cost of advertising (finding customers). A critical
        mass of supply is necessary, as the marginal advertising cost is reduced for each market participant with each
        additional supply unit.</p>
      <p><i>Regulatory Issues</i></p>
      <p>Two possible reasons for regulation: (1) to protect consumers (in response to market failure), (2) to protect
        incumbents. </p>
      <p>There isn't a global reputation system for contractor workers. This was pitched as a business idea recently

          Analysis of the Labor Market for Uberâ€™s Driver-Partners in the United States"</a> <i>NBER Working Paper
          Series</i> 2016</div>
      <div class="summary">
        <p>Hall is now Uber's Chief Economist and Alan Krueger was a Princeton labor economist who served as chair of
          the Council of Economic Advisors in the Obama administration.</p>
        <p>Through direct access to Uber's observed ride data and driver surveys, Hall and Krueger determine Uber
          drivers
          greatly prefer the flexibility Uber offers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="notes">
        <p><i>Uber driver growth has been driven by people seeking flexible work arrangements</i></p>
        <p>
          When surveyed, 3 out of the top 4 reasons for joining Uber were related to having control of work scheduling.
        </p>
        <p>UberX growth was exponential, whereas UberBlack growth was linear. Proportion of drivers driving 15 or fewer
          hours a week trended up, whereas
          drivers driving between 16 to 35 hours and 35+ hours trended down. UberBlack drivers are more likely </p>
        <p>When surveyed, 74% (5%) of drivers said Uber made their life better (worse).</p>
        <p>When asked to state preference between work descriptions that corresponded to independent contractor versus
          employee relationships, 79% of drivers
          said they would prefer an independent contractor relationship.</p>
        <p>Female drivers were more likely to state a preference for flexibility than male drivers were. This reminds me
          of
          findings of Claudia Goldin.</p>
        <p><i>Uber is largely supplemental income</i></p>
        <p>80% of drivers report they were working full- or part-time before
          starting on Uber. 10% of drivers were unemployed immediately before joining Uber. For the overall economy, 25%
          of
          new hires come from unemployment.</p>
        <p><i>The number one factor in driver growth was meeting unmet demand</i></p>
        <p>Number of Uber drivers in a city is a linear function of (1) city's population, (2) how long Uber has been
          operating in the city, and (3) log number of existing taxi licenses. All factors are positive, so (3)'s
          implication is that the the more licenses there are, the more unmet demand there was (or, the more artifically
          constrained supply was). Factors that did not determine driver growth include (1) population density, (2)
          population GDP, (3) taxi earnings, (4) regional unemployment, (5) cost of a 5-mile trip in the city, and (5)
          cars
          as a proportion of poulation.</p>
